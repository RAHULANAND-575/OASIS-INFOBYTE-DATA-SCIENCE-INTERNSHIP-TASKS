1. Iris Flower Classification
Description:
This project involves classifying iris flowers into three different species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on their features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal is to build a predictive model using the Iris dataset to accurately classify new iris samples.

Modules:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data distributions, feature correlations, and species separability.
Model Training: Implementing algorithms such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM).
Model Evaluation: Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
Deployment: Creating a web application for live classification (optional).
Objective:
To develop a model that can accurately classify iris flowers into their respective species and understand the importance of each feature in the classification process.

2. Car Price Prediction
Description:
The objective of this project is to predict the selling price of used cars based on various attributes such as car name, year, present price, driven kilometers, fuel type, selling type, transmission, and owner. This involves building a regression model to estimate the carâ€™s price.

Modules:

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outlier detection, and feature encoding.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features from existing data to improve model performance.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing relationships between features and target variable.
Model Building: Implementing regression algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
Model Evaluation: Using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
Objective:
To create an accurate prediction model for used car prices that can assist buyers and sellers in determining fair prices based on car features.

3. Unemployment Analysis
Description:
This project aims to analyze unemployment trends and patterns using historical unemployment data. The analysis helps in understanding factors affecting unemployment rates and predicting future trends.

Modules:

Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gathering data from reliable sources, cleaning, and transforming the data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing unemployment trends over time, by region, and across various demographics.
Statistical Analysis: Performing hypothesis testing and correlation analysis.
Visualization: Creating time-series plots, heatmaps, and bar charts to represent unemployment data.
Prediction: Implementing time-series forecasting methods like ARIMA or Exponential Smoothing.
Objective:
To provide insights into unemployment trends and factors, enabling policymakers and researchers to make data-driven decisions.

4. Sales Prediction Using Advertising Data
Description:
This project focuses on predicting sales based on advertising expenditure in different media channels (TV, radio, and newspaper). The goal is to understand how advertising investments influence sales and to forecast future sales.

Modules:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the dataset for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzing the impact of each advertising channel on sales.
Model Building: Using regression models to understand the relationship between advertising expenditure and sales.
Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics such as R-squared and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Optimization: Identifying optimal advertising spending strategies.
Objective:
To develop a model that predicts sales based on advertising expenditure, helping businesses optimize their marketing budget.

5. Email Spam Detection
Description:
This project aims to build a spam filter that classifies emails as spam or non-spam based on their content. It involves preprocessing email text, feature extraction, and model training to identify and filter out spam emails.

Modules: 

Data Preprocessing: Text cleaning, tokenization, and normalization.
Feature Extraction: Using techniques such as TF-IDF or word embeddings to convert text into numerical features.
Model Training: Implementing classification algorithms like Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Logistic Regression.
Model Evaluation: Using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Deployment: Integrating the model into an email system for real-time spam detection.
Objective:
To build an effective spam detection system that improves email management and reduces unwanted spam.
